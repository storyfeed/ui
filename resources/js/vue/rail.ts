/**
 * WHICH FACT THE RAIL ANSWERS FIRST — who, or what.
 *
 * A port of `Storyfeed\Filament\Feeds\Rail`, kept deliberately literal: two
 * slots and three values, a PRIMARY (the 2rem disc) and a SECONDARY (the badge
 * on its lower corner), each holding the actor, the activity, or nothing, and
 * the two never holding the same thing. Four legal configurations, no fifth.
 *
 *     actor          actor / activity    who did it, then what
 *     activity       activity / actor    what happened, then who
 *     activity-only  activity / none     the actor is constant; the badge is noise
 *     actor-only     actor / none        one face, no badge
 *
 * SEMANTICS, NOT APPEARANCE. Nothing here reaches a colour, a size or a shape:
 * the disc is the same disc and the badge the same badge. What a consumer
 * chooses is which of two facts the eye meets first.
 *
 * WHY THIS KIT'S DEFAULT IS NOT THE PLUGIN'S. The Filament plugin defaults to
 * `actor` — a face with the verb badged onto it. This kit is the Newsroom's
 * renderer and has always drawn one face and no badge, which is `actor-only`,
 * with group children drawing the verb alone, which is `activity-only`. Naming
 * what it already does costs no page a repaint; see `railFor`.

 * MORE THAN ONE FACE SUPPRESSES IT. Geometry: a badge over a stacked pair sits
