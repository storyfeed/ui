/**
 * One picture, at the feed's scale.
 *
 * The image object is core's `FeedImage`, minted by the resolver at READ time,
 * so the src is current however old the row is. `width` and `height` are
 * advisory: they reserve the box before the bytes arrive, which is what stops
 * a feed jumping as photos load.
 *
 * A tile in a group's strip is the other caller, and it differs in one way: a
 * tile stands for an entity and keeps that entity's link, where a row's own
 * picture does not navigate — the payload's `entity.url` for a photo IS the
 * full file, so tapping one would leave the feed for a raw image.
